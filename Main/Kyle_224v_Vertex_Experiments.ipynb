        "* The Silence Rule: If Proposition proves X is true and Opposition never mentions X, then X is a fact in this debate. You must weigh this fact in your final decision.\n",

Argumentation & Analysis \\u2022 Proposition set out a clear mechanism showing how the \\u201cnatural-is-better\\u201d norm directly fuels high-magnitude, contemporary harms: (i) anti-vaccination deaths, (ii) blindness and mortality from blocked GM crops, (iii) maternal morbidity via \\u201cnatural birth\\u201d stigma.  They explained causal chains (norm \\u2192 distrust of artificial interventions \\u2192 refusal/ delay \\u2192 concrete deaths) and quantified impacts. \\u2022 Opposition\\u2019s counter-mechanism \\u2013 that the norm is a prudent \\u201cspeed-bump\\u201d which averts environmental catastrophe \\u2013 remained largely asserted.  Climate change, plastics and chemical spills arose while the norm already existed, so they never convincingly showed that the norm is either necessary or sufficient to deliver the precaution they celebrate. \\u2022 On evolutionary compatibility, Proposition convincingly turned the point by demonstrating multiple mismatches (sugar cravings, poor eyesight, tribalism) and showing civilisation is an ongoing project of correcting \\u201cnature\\u2019s bugs.\\u201d  Opposition\\u2019s reply\\u2014\\u201cthose are exceptions\\u201d\\u2014was insufficiently developed. 2. Engagement & Rebuttal \\u2022 Proposition anticipated and dismantled Opposition\\u2019s \\u201cmisinterpretation\\u201d push: they argued that if society is taught to prize \\u201cnatural purity,\\u201d predictable misuse (anti-vax, anti-GMO) is part of the norm, not an aberration.  Opposition never provided a credible firewall explaining why the rhetoric of naturalness in food would not spill into health or social policy; thus the point stands. \\u2022 Opposition did answer the anti-vax / GMO harms but only by relabelling them \\u201cirrational extremism,\\u201d leaving the original causal links substantially uncontested.  Conversely, Proposition directly engaged with every major benefit Opposition claimed (precautionary principle, sustainability, humility) and showed alternative, non-biased ways\\u2014universal evidence-based testing\\u2014to obtain those goods. 3. Role Fulfilment Both sides defined and defended their burdens adequately, but Proposition\\u2019s initial definition was clear, fair and carried through consistently.  Opposition\\u2019s attempt to narrow the norm to \\u201cmaterial substances only\\u201d looked like a partial re-definition and cost them some credibility. 4. Impact Weighing We weigh tangible, already-occurring deaths (hundreds of thousands annually; imminent blindness of children) against prospective, speculative harms that the Opposition never linked uniquely to the presence or absence of the norm.  Even if Opposition prevents some future environmental misstep, Proposition\\u2019s demonstrated life-loss today outweighs. 5. Clarity All speakers were articulate; slight edge to Proposition for clearer internal structure and sign-posting. Adding up strict but proportional speaker scores gives Proposition 240 vs. Opposition 234.  Because Proposition wins on both impact calculus and total numerical score, the debate goes to the Proposition.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
